%% You can then either use BibTeX with the ACM-Reference-Format style,

\begin{abstract}
  A clear and well-documented \LaTeX\ document is presented as an
  article formatted for publication by ACM in a conference proceedings
  or journal publication. Based on the ``acmart'' document class, this
  article presents and explains many of the common variations, as well
  as many of the formatting elements an author may use in the
  preparation of the documentation of their work.
  If I were to name this system, it should be \systemname. Testing updates from Overleaf.
